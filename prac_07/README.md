# Practical 07
## Brief information
My name is Lin Pyae Htet and this is practical 7.
Here are 3 main lessons I learned about "clean code" in this subject:
- I learned that a python class name starts with a capital and no underscores (uses a title case).
- Object type comparisons should always use isinstance() instead of comparing types directly
- I learned about overload operators
