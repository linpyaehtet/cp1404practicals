# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Mostly, it is accurate but sometimes it's just way off by minutes. 

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

My estimate accuracy improved when I started wasting less time if I get stuck on a particular part of a program.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned to not waste time on being stuck and coming up with a solution for one problem. I can continue to
work on other parts of the program to be more efficient.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned many things that I wasn't aware of, like not putting docstrings under each methods in the class.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I learned more about naming conventions and best practices, doing code reviews of other people because
that's the area where most of them make mistakes in.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Code review for jc972271](https://github.com/jc972271/cp1404practicals/pull/5#pullrequestreview-2456628162)

### Explanation

I think this code review was good because I specified that he missed the docstrings for class and function
It wasn't also similar to the sample, so I fixed it.

### Good Code Review 2

[Code review for Winminoo444](https://github.com/Winminoo4444/cp1404practicals/pull/6#pullrequestreview-2471434522)

### Explanation

I pointed out a lot of things like refactoring his error-checking part into a function as well as adding docstrings.
I also pointed out to use constants for the menu options. I think this one is my best one because I found
a lot of things to point out.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

Nothing, just add more guides/instructions on prac 10 in flaskdemo for adding content on pages. 

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I did really well in following the instructions and my problem-solving skills were improved as well.
I also understood the instructions well and my outputs matched the sample outputs.
